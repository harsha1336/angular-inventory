    <h2>About This Application</h2>
    <p>
      This is a simple <strong>Inventory Management System</strong> that allows users to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>View available products</li>
      <li>Add new products to the inventory</li>
      <li>Edit product details</li>
      <li>Delete products when needed</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The application is built with <strong>Angular</strong> for the front-end and a <strong>JSON server</strong> as a mock back-end.
